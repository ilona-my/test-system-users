# test-system-users
Users - a free testing system with diverse functionality and various bugs. It was created by the testing coach, Olga Nazina, to allow anyone interested in testing to use it for educational and practical purposes. The system itself has been developed as a platform for the employee management.

Test System Users is my personal project dedicated to testing of the mentioned system and created as part of final project for completion of the Manual QA course at the Beetroot Academy.

Testing that was performed addresses those items and elements that pertain to critical functionality of the system. The main testing types and techniques executed: functional testing, GUI testing, API testing, load testing, automated testing.

For detailed description of the project, refer to the Test Plan.
